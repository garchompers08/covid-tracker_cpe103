# COVID-19 Tracer CPE103_Proj

Being infected with COVID-19 is no joke, thus everyone should be organized when going outside their homes. Through this, the group's goal is to make a covid tracker which will store data of weekly updates for people.  This would monitor their activities or movements through locations and monitoring symptoms. Our program would consist of collecting the inputs of each individualâ€™s demographic profile such as name, gender, age, etc. We will also collect the exact time and date of when an individual left their homes and the approximate location where he/she went. It also displays the time and date of the last leave of each of the individuals living in the community.


The program will help the community manage the affected areas to minimize casualties through locating and monitoring the movement of people. The group can also provide a detailed breakdown of informational profiles for the government's usage.  In case of a sudden outbreak, we can then minimize the impact as we can track and lock down areas that may have been exposed or affected by the virus which we can then easily help monitor who was at those specific places and times through their history provided by our database.


The program will execute after opening the software. This will prompt the user if they will input in the .txt file given or output the arranged sample data given by us. There would be a prompt for the inputs, first is Input 1 where it is designed for users who will go to their houses, this would make the user input what time he/she will go out and where specifically. This Input 2 on the new person would be placed in a database, which will place the Name, Age, Gender, Contact #, and Residential Address.


This covid tracker software would prove to be useful in decreasing the further spread of the virus and aims to mitigate the spread of the virus.

Users may not input their real information, or may not even attempt to open or use the software at all, which renders this program useless.
