# covid-tracker_cpe103
Being infected with COVID-19 is no joke, thus everyone should be organized when going outside their homes. Through this, the group's goal is to make a covid tracker which will store data of weekly updates for people.  This would monitor their activities or movements through locations and monitoring symptoms. Our program would consist of collecting the inputs of each individualâ€™s demographic profile such as name, gender, age, etc. We will also collect the exact time and date of when an individual left their homes and the approximate location where he/she went. It also displays the time and date of the last leave of each of the individuals living in the community.
